            <h3>Our Story</h3>

            <p>It began with a quest for the perfect burger. Our founder, a backyard grill master with impossibly high standards, was tired of mediocre patties. He started grinding his own beef blend, baking buns daily, and crafting signature sauces.

                The result was a burger so delicious, the only words people could muster were "Holy Cow!" The name stuck. That simple pursuit of perfection, right down to the last pickle, is what still drives us today.

                We didn't search the galaxy for the best burger. We built it right here.
